               and we're experts in making decisions. We are talented statisticians, we know our way around software development and web design and we are experts in data science and machine learning, but this doesn't define us. Rather, we bring all these threads together, along with
               philosophy, psychology and even some literary theory, to a greater purpose: that of making good, well-thought-out choices that let you meet your goals.

               <span id="firstwords">Data, design, decision</span>
               is how we work. We begin with data: we find what evidence we have that's salient to the context we're working in, and if we need more we collect it. From there, we work with you to design questions that you can ask that relate to the decisions you want to make.
               We then apply the evidence we've gathered to the questions we've asked, designing a framework in which you make the decisions important to your task.

               <span id="firstwords">Our principal consultant</span>
               Iris is a skilled scholar with expertise across multiple disciplines, all focused on decisions and design. Whether using market data to tell stories, digging deep to find the underlying causes behind unusually successful schools or even modelling fracture dynamics
               in polymers, her purpose is always to help her clients make the best decisions they possibly can, empowering them to achieve their aims. Iris holds a Masters' Degree in Engineering Science from the University of Auckland and has seven years of industry experience in the fields of statistics,
               data science and machine learning. Where Iris's considerable skills don't cover the needs of the task at hand, Noether Analytics' wider team rounds out the company's skill set and provides advice and support.
