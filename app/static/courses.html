                    <span id="firstwords">Making decisions with data</span>
                    We all make decisions in different ways. Some of us rely entirely on gut feeling. Some of us go with what the people important to us believe. Some of us lean heavily on data to justify our decisions, but never think about what it is we actually want, and some of us rely on logic, but never think about what evidence goes into our decisions. Most of us probably use a mix of these techniques.
                </p>
                <p>While whatever strategies you have in place are useful and effective, there are many gains to be made from a more deliberative, evidence-based, conscious approach to decision-making, by far the most important of which is that they’re more likely to be accurate, and thus that they’ll inform your decision-making in a way that makes your choices better. This course thus aims to help you introduce more conscious, deliberate and data-based elements into your decisions.</p>
                <p>This course doesn’t aim to turn you into a consummate statistician: that would take a lot of work and dedication and might actually be counterproductive to success in your field. What it does aim to do is give you the skills and tools to assess data and claims based on it, and use what is good in it to make decisions. We’ll teach you to extract arguments from text, break them down and see how they hold together. We’ll then teach you where data fits into this framework and what inferences we can and can’t draw from the data you have available. Finally, we’ll teach you how to use your own data to make decisions and support arguments in an accurate, ethical and reasoned manner.</p>

                    <span id="firstwords">Designing for diversity</span>
                    The moral case for diverse, inclusive and equal workplaces where institutional power is not monopolised by one group at the expense of another is at this point unassailable (or, rather, if you don’t agree with this fairly basic statement, we really don’t want anything to do with you). While this should be more than enough to prompt anyone to act, there is also strong evidence that diverse workplaces are more economically successful.
                </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there’s an equally large wealth of knowledge that shows that the traditional methods of attempting to create such a state of affairs range from ineffective to downright counterproductive. Inclusion and diversity training has been shown to not change attitudes or behaviours, and in fact have sometimes been shown to increase biased behaviour observed in the workplace. If you’re interested in changing behaviours, therefore, different solutions are required.</p>
                <p>So, what does work? In this half-day course you will learn evidence-based techniques for creating a diverse, inclusive and equal workplace on both a personal and institutional level. Using insights from statistics, psychology, moral philosophy and economics, we aim to give you a set of tools that you can use both to make better, more equitable choices yourself and to make it easier for people in your organisation to do so.</p>

                    <span id="firstwords">Hiring for a strong team</span>
                    Hiring candidates that perform poorly comes at a very high cost: values quoted in the literature for the financial cost of hiring someone unsuited to their role range from 50% to 250% of their annual salary. Furthermore, this is only the direct financial cost: low productivity, lowered morale, damaged client relations and wasted time rehiring for the position mean that, while it’s impossible to eliminate the risk of hiring the wrong person, you should do everything you can to make the risk as low as possible.
                </p>
                <p>Most techniques for hiring fall short of that line. Unstructured interviews, for example, have a vast literature suggesting that they are simply not valid for choosing good candidates and perform no better than random in choosing the best candidate from a shortlist: despite this, they still see common use in hiring processes. Even in cases where the technique itself is valid, as with CVs, human bias gets in the way when they’re used inappropriately. As the majority of people are invested in making the best possible choice of hire, these tools clearly aren’t being used out of malice, but rather, people simply don’t have better ones. This course aims to change that.</p>
                <p>In this five-part course you will learn how to design every stage of your hiring process to hire the best candidates you possibly can. Starting with defining the role you’re hiring for, through drafting the ideal job ad and circulating it in the right places, to how to best assess CVs and interview candidates and ending with onboarding and the first few months at work, we’ll teach you how to make the best choices for your organisation, leading to happier, healthier staff who will stay with you for longer and a more productive, profitable workplace.</p>
                <p>Time: Five half-day sessions, scheduled weekly, fortnightly or monthly</p>
                <p>Cost: $6000</p>
                <p>Maximum participants: 12</p>

                    <span id="firstwords">How not to think about data</span>
                    Machine learning and data science are new, somewhat esoteric and extremely powerful disciplines that have had an outsized impact on the world over the last ten years. They’ve brought down governments, revolutionised how we see the world and made trillions of dollars in profits. They cannot be ignored.
                </p>
                <p>Of course, as with any new business fashion, the field attracts scam artists like moths to a flame. People make claims for what the tools of the discipline can do that range from implausible to outright impossible. Jargon is hurled around like a smoke grenade, aiming to conceal more than clarify. And the worst of this is that if you’re not already very familiar with the field, you have no way of assessing whether anything said about a data science or machine learning project is true or not. Clearly a plain-language, non-mathematical briefing on the discipline is needed.</p>
                <p>In this two-hour workshop, you will learn what machine learning and data science are as academic fields and as industrial tools. You will learn what kinds of problems they can be applied to, where they fall down, and how to assess claims by others about data science and machine learning projects. You won’t be able to do machine learning at the end of this course, but at the very least you’ll be much more prepared to ask the right questions the next time someone tries to sell you something featuring it.</p>
                <p>Time: Two hours</p>
                <p>Cost: $600</p>
                <p>Maximum participants: 20</p>
